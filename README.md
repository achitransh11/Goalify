Installation
To get started with the project, follow the steps below:

1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/achitransh11/Goalify.git
cd Goalify
2. Install Dependencies
Run the following command to install all the necessary dependencies:
npm install
3. Start the Development Server
Once the dependencies are installed, start the development server:

  npm start
The app will be available at http://localhost:3000 by default.

4. Build for Production
To create a production-ready build, run:

npm run build
This will create an optimized build in the build/ directory.

5. Run Tests
To run the unit and integration tests, execute:

npm test
This will run Jest and execute all the test cases in the project.

6. Eject (Optional)
If you need to customize the build configuration (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.), you can eject from the create-react-app setup:

npm run eject
This will expose all the configuration files so you can make manual modifications. Note: This is a one-way operation and cannot be undone.
